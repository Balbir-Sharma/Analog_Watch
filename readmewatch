Calculation of the formula for hour, minute and second

For 1 rotation, 12 hours are needed. Therefore 12hrs = 360 degree
                     12 = 360 
                     1 hr = 30 degree
Now we have to add extra hour-hand that are did through minute-hand. So, 
1hour = 60 minute
60 minute =30degree
1 degree  = 30/60 => 1/2
So, finally add       1 minute =m/2

Now we have to add extra hour-hand that are did through second-hand.But we are adding this because it is neglible.


Total hour-hand (h-hour) = (30h + m/2)








For 1 rotation, 60 minute are needed. Therefore 60 minute = 360 degree
                     60 = 360 
                     1 minute = 6 degree







                     For 1 rotation, 60 second are needed. Therefore 60 second = 360 degree
                     60 = 360 
                     1 second = 6 degree
